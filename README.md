# Dame (だめ)
An experimental Game Boy and ~~Game Boy Color~~ emulator written in C#, written mostly as an excercise in producing efficient .NET code (still ways to go). Rumor has it that it's extremely fun. Writing an emulator, that is.

And the part where you get to display the Nintendo logo certainly is.
