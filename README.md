# Dame (だめ)

(This is an early work in progress not much of the code, except the processor, works and there are certainly bugs)

An experimental Game Boy and ~~Game Boy Color~~ emulator written in C#, written mostly as an excercise in producing efficient .NET code. Rumor has it that it's extremely fun.

## Showcase

Coming soon!
